# Eatery 

## Practical Questions:

##### _What does this app do?_
Eatery helps narrow down the restaurant search by providing a clean and simple interface that filters based on various parameters and guides you towards options that fit your current needs. 

##### _Why did we build this app?_
We found that most other restaurant apps didn't provide a clean user experience of narrowing down the restaurant search to fit the vibe of the evening. If you need a bar that also serves delicious appetizers in a certain neighborhood of the city our app allows for a simple and easy sorting process that will leave you with a short list of the best options. Our main goal in building this app was to create a useful tool for food and drink lovers to find the best option for any occasion. 

## User Stories

### User is able to...

Choose what type of establishment they are currently looking for and be shown results that fit their criteria. They can show results based on neighborhood and quickly decide on where to go.

Users or Restaurant Owners can also add an establishment that they don't see in our database to help guide other users.

## Technologies Used

### FrontEnd
##### ReactJS
##### Javascript

### BackEnd
##### Ruby
##### Sinatra
##### PostgreSQL

### Code description

We used ReactJS to track the users inputs in state and lead them down relavent questions based on their decisions. We then used state and the users inputs to filter results and show the user Eateries that fit the users needs.
